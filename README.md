My name is Marcia!
I program in Python but I am able to program in HTML, CSS and I am working on learning JS.
This is all my hobby and I never really learnt from any courses so I may not follow the conventional rules of programming (as I don't know them)!
I am more then happy to learn from anyone about any of the programming languages that I work with! So feel free to correct me, or teach me some new ways to code. 
My discord is @marcia1134, anyone is more then welcome to message me their on any account of my code or projects.

I am wanting to work with other programmers on some larger projects and I would love if you reached out with an idea or concept or messaged me about joining a project I am already working on!
